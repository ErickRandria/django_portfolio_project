    <p>
      I am graduated from
      <a href="https://www.leeds.ac.uk/">the University of Leeds</a>, UK. I
      pursued a MSc in Astronomy and Data Science. I was one those who have been
      selected to receive the awards from the Newton funds. I have accummulated
      a lot from my academic path but the problem is that how we.

    <p>
      I am a developer with experience in Python and Odoo, as well as a range of
      other skills including full stack development, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and
      Figma. I have completed several individual projects and am always looking
      for new opportunities and challenges to improve my skills and advance my
      career. I am currently seeking new opportunities and am excited to tackle
      challenging problems and grow as a developer.

    <h2>The DARA Big Data project</h2>
    <p>
      The project is led by Prof. Anna Scaife of the Jodrell Bank Centre for
      Astrophysics (JBCA) at the University of Manchester and collaborates with
      partner organizations in South Africa and universities across the UK
      (Leeds, Hertfordshire, Sussex, York). DARA Big Data aims to ensure that
      African students can fully engage in the technological advancements
      associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR)—a global shift
      towards extensive use of <strong>AI</strong>, <strong>robotics</strong>,
      and <strong>smart devices connected to the Internet of Things</strong>. By
      providing intensive skills training, young people across the continent
      will significantly benefit from the vast opportunities presented by both
      4IR and the SKA.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      DARA Big Data was established in 2017 in response to the need for data
      science training in African countries, particularly those most affected by
      the SKA (Square Kilometre Array) Telescope. When completed, the SKA will
      be the world’s largest radio telescope, with a portion located in South
      Africa. Partner countries across Africa, including Botswana, Ghana, Kenya,
      Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, and Zambia, will form a
      continental radio telescope network known as the African VLBI Network
      (AVN).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The aim of DARA Big Data is to equip students from these 8 countries with
      the skills necessary to translate and analyze the massive amounts of data
      generated by the telescope. This training extends beyond astronomy to
      fields such as agriculture, medical sciences, and data-driven
      policy-making.

    <h2>The Big Data Africa School</h2>
    <p>
      The aim of the School was to teach the students important techniques when
      working with large data sets, so that they can then apply what they had
      learnt to their own postgraduate research. To achieve this objective,
      students were provided access to “real-life” astronomy, healthcare and
      sustainable agriculture data sets, which they were required to use to
      answer “real-life” problems.
